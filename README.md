# Haskell Learning

## Introduction

This repository contains a collection of Haskell code files that I'm working on purely out of curiosity and for learning purposes. I'm exploring Haskell to gain a deeper understanding of functional programming concepts and the language itself.

## Usage
You can use these code files to learn more about Haskell, experiment with the language, or adapt them for your own projects.

## Contributions

While this repository is primarily for my personal learning, I welcome feedback and suggestions from the Haskell community. If you spot any improvements or have insights to share, please feel free to open an issue or reach out to me.

## Code Samples

Here are some examples of the Haskell code snippets you'll find in this repository:

1. **Hello, World!**

```haskell
main :: IO ()
main = putStrLn "Hello, World!"
